This is an example Android Application README to show briefly the sections your app README should contain.

## Installation

```

## Configuration
### Keystores:
Create `app/keystore.gradle` with the following info:
```gradle
ext.key_alias='...'
ext.key_password='...'
ext.store_password='...'
```
And place both keystores under `app/keystores/` directory:
- `playstore.keystore`
- `stage.keystore`

## Generating signed APK
From Android Studio:
